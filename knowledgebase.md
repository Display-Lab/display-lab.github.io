An information content entity about a process through which an implementation
strategy operates to affect desired implementation outcomes.

We have 9 Causal Pathways. Each Causal Pathway has a specific mechanism of
action/implementation strategy and unique combination of preconditions.


## Dictionary
**Precondition** : An information content entity that is necessary for a mechanism
or implementation outcome to be activated.

**Moderator** : An information content entity that may affect the level of
influence of an implementation strategy.

**Proximal Outcome** : An information content entity that represents the outcome
of the implementation strategy that is realized because of its specific mechanism
of action, and is the most immediate, observable outcome in the causal pathway.

**Distal Outcome** : An information content entity that represents the outcome
that represents the outcome that a candidate intervention is designed to achieve.
